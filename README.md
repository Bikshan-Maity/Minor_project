Project Title: Automated Irrigation and Fish Feeding System

Description:
This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for an innovative project that aims to automate irrigation and fish feeding processes using modern technology. The project integrates NodeMCU, a soil moisture sensor, a relay module, and a servo motor to create a smart system that efficiently manages soil irrigation and fish feeding.

Features:

Automated Irrigation: The system utilizes a soil moisture sensor to monitor soil moisture levels. When the soil becomes dry, the relay module triggers a water pump to irrigate the plants, ensuring optimal growth and water conservation.

Scheduled Fish Feeding: A servo motor is employed to rotate a container filled with fish food. The NodeMCU controls the servo, allowing scheduled feeding of fish, which is vital for their health and growth.

Energy Efficient: The system is designed to work with an external power supply, ensuring continuous operation without interruptions.
